# AWS Organizations

This component creates an AWS Organization for the master account and creates child accounts as a part of the organization.

## Usage

A run of this component is required after the initial master account bootsrap for completing the child account boostrap, as these accounts required to be created first

If CI automation does not yet exist in the project, a manual run as described in the root README can be performed.
